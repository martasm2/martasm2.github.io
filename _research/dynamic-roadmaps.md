While planning in dynamic environments, we need to take into account the movements of humans and other agents.
In order to maintain functionality of roadmaps, such as those used in sampling-based planning, we need to
efficiently update validities of nodes and edges.<br>

To that end we propose a new method <a href="https://martasm2.github.io/publication/2024-10-07-spite">SPITE</a> (Simple Polyhedral Intersection Techniques for modified Environments).<br>

See <a href="https://martasm2.github.io/publications/">publications</a> for more details.
